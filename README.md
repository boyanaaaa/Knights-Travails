# Knight's Travails – Shortest Knight Path on Chessboard
This project solves the Knights Travails problem from The Odin Project using Breadth-First Search (BFS).

📝 **Description**

This program calculates the most efficient path a knight can take on a chessboard from a starting square to a target square.
It uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to guarantee that the path found requires the fewest possible moves.
The program outputs a list of all the squares the knight stops on along the way.
